ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* .idea\
* .idea\Demo.iml
* .idea\compiler.xml
* .idea\copyright\
* .idea\copyright\profiles_settings.xml
* .idea\encodings.xml
* .idea\misc.xml
* .idea\modules.xml
* .idea\workspace.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => newPay_Apk_demo\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => newPay_Apk_demo\src\main\assets\
* libs\BmobPay_v3.0.3_160621.jar => newPay_Apk_demo\libs\BmobPay_v3.0.3_160621.jar
* proguard-project.txt => newPay_Apk_demo\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => newPay_Apk_demo\src\main\res\
* src\ => newPay_Apk_demo\src\main\java\
* src\.DS_Store => newPay_Apk_demo\src\main\resources\.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
